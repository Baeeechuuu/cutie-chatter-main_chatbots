# CutieChatter Authentication System Setup Guide

## 🎉 Authentication System Status: **WORKING** ✅

The login page for CutieChatter has been successfully fixed and is now fully functional!

## 📋 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Method Name Mismatches**
- **Issue**: JavaScript was calling `authBridge.login()` but Python had `signIn()`
- **Solution**: Added alias methods `login()` and `register()` in `auth_bridge.py`

### 2. **Missing Methods**
- **Issue**: `continueAsGuest()` method didn't exist
- **Solution**: Implemented `continueAsGuest()` method for guest mode

### 3. **Missing Error Signals**
- **Issue**: JavaScript expected `authError` signal but it wasn't implemented
- **Solution**: Added `authError = pyqtSignal(str)` and proper error handling

### 4. **Signal Conflicts**
- **Issue**: Method name conflict with signal name `redirectToMain`
- **Solution**: Renamed method to `redirectToMainApp()`

## 🔍 Testing the System

✅ User registration  
✅ User login  
✅ Session verification  
✅ Chat data storage  
✅ User logout  
✅ Password reset  
✅ Guest mode  

## 🚨 Important Notes

### First Time Setup
1. Make sure you have all required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install PyQt6 PyQt6-WebEngine
   ```

2. The database (`cutiechatter_users.db`) will be created automatically on first run

### Development Mode
- Email verification is **disabled** for easy testing
- Password reset tokens are shown in console
- All users are automatically verified

### Production Considerations
If deploying for production:
- Enable email verification in `auth.py`
- Set up proper email SMTP configuration
- Remove demo features (showing reset tokens)
- Use HTTPS for the web interface

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Authentication bridge tidak tersedia"  
**Solution**: Make sure `auth_bridge.py` is properly imported in `cutie.py`

**Issue**: Login button stuck on "Memproses..."  
**Solution**: Check console for Python errors, ensure database is accessible

**Issue**: Theme not switching  
**Solution**: Clear browser cache or local storage

### Debug Functions
Open browser developer tools (F12) and try:
```javascript
// Test bridge connection
window.debugAuth.testBridge()

// Simulate login
window.debugAuth.simulateLogin()
```

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure the database file has proper permissions
4. Check that `auth.html` is in the same directory as `cutie.py`
